	  <h2>About shape note singing</h2>
    
      <p>Shape note music is a 200-year-old, uniquely American style of hymn singing. 
	  This tradition is also known as Sacred Harp, after the title of 
      the best-known shape note tunebook.  These haunting 4-part harmonies are sung 
      in powerful, exuberant style, with singers seated in an open square.
	  We sing not for performance but for the joy of singing and the community of singers, 
	  to which newcomers are always welcome.</p>

	  <p>
	  Georgia is in the middle of the traditional shape note heartland. <i>The Sacred Harp</i> was published in 1844
	  by Georgia residents B. F. White and E. J. King.  
	  Shape note singing survives as a living tradition in Georgia to this day.
	  New singers from many different backgrounds are attracted to the powerful old songs
	  and find that shape note singing is a release for the spirit and a lot of fun.</p>


      <p>
	  If you have not tried shape note singing before, see our
	  <a href="http://atlantasacredharp.org/beginner.html">what-to-expect page</a>.
      For general information, see 
	  <a href="http://www.fasola.org/">Fasola.org</a> and 
	  <a href="http://home.olemiss.edu/~mudws/harp.html">Warren Steel's Sacred Harp site</a>.
	  But <i>The 
      Sacred Harp</i> is not for reading about. It is for singing. 
	  Find a singing and raise your voice.

	  <h2>About us</h2>
	  <p>Atlanta Sacred Harp Singers is an informal network of people interested in participating 
in and promoting singing from the Sacred Harp and other shape note books in the Atlanta area.  
We occasionally round up a group of volunteer singers for demonstrations of Sacred Harp singing for other 
organizations and events.  And of course, we support shape note singing with our voices at regular 
and special singing events whenever and wherever we can.  </p>
