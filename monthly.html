      <p>October 2025 Atlanta Singing Reminder</p>

      <p>
        As the roll out of the 2025 Revision of the Sacred Harp gets underway, it might be best practice to keep your 1991 book handy. Some have the new
        revision and some don't. Moving forward, local groups and all day singings and conventions will need to decide on adoption of the revision as their
        'book'. If you are an organizer, please post in the Sacred Harp Atlanta facebook group or send John Plunkett a message, whether you have 2025 loaner
        books or books for sale.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you missed the United Convention and want to get your own copy of the 2025 Sacred Harp, you can order
        <a href="https://sacredharp.com/" target="_blank">here (note new website!)</a> (Delivery on the 2nd printing is expected in early October and pending
        online orders will start being fulfilled then)
      </p>
