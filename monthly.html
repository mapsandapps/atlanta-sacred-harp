        ***<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/623819150541908/" target="_blank">CANCELED</a>*** Mar 20, 3rd Thursday - 7pm-9pm.  Come join us to sing from the Sacred Harp in Pine Lake, GA, at the Clubhouse on Thursday evening, March 20th! We will sing from 7-9 with a break in the middle, and the option to sing for an extra half hour if we want. Bring a snack to share if you are inclined! The Clubhouse has a kitchen facility you can use if needed. This singing is a good opportunity for the local Atlanta Sacred Harp community to gather in Pine Lake to test out the clubhouse building and see if we like it. (There is another building in Pine Lake on the lakefront that we would like to test out for singing, as well, so depending on how March 20th goes we can see about trying the other building and comparing the two.) This is also an opportunity for some local Pine Lake residents to see and try out Sacred Harp singing. Pine Lake is known for its love of arts, culture, and community-building, so hopefully some locals will take an interest and maybe join us to sing elsewhere around Atlanta, or in April for some of the singing schools and all-day singing.<br />
