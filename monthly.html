      <p>Four-Shape Singing School with David Ivey</p>

      <p>4:00-5:30 pm, Friday, April 4, 2025, Wesley Teaching Chapel, Candler School of Theology, Rita Ann Rollins Building, Room 264, 1531 Dickey Dr., Atlanta GA 30322</p>

      <p>Singing School Teacher: David Ivey (Sacred Harp Musical Heritage Association)</p>

      <p>Shape-note music uses shaped note heads to convey pitch. During their heyday in the nineteenth century, several shape note systems were in competition across the US South. Largely eclipsed by 1900, four-shape notation remains in use at Sacred Harp singings across the country and globe. In this public session, learn how to sing four-shape music and experience historic four-shape repertoire with singing school teacher and President of the Sacred Harp Musical Heritage Association, David Ivey, of Huntsville, Alabama.</p>

      <p>Song Leader: Tom Powell (Alabama School of Gospel Music)</p>

      <p>Pianist: Tracey Phillips</p>

      <p>"New book" gospel conventions became popular in the early twentieth century as community events where seven-shape gospel publishers introduced their latest music books. In this public session, we’ll be singing from “old” “new books” featured in the Sounding Spirit Digital Library and contemporary seven-shape gospel publications. Tom Powell, Director of Instruction at the Alabama School of Gospel Music will be leading with renowned gospel pianist Tracey Phillips. Tracey has taught and accompanied for many years at Ben Speer’s Stamps Baxter School of Music and the Alabama School of Gospel Music.</p>

      <p>Choral Arrangement Singing School with Derrick Fox</p>

      <p>11:00 am-12:30 pm, Saturday, April 5, 2025, Wesley Teaching Chapel, Candler School of Theology, Rita Ann Rollins Building, Room 264, 1531 Dickey Dr., Atlanta GA 30322</p>

      <p>Singing School Teacher: Derrick Fox (Michigan State University)</p>

      <p>Choral arrangements of nineteenth- and twentieth-century southern sacred vernacular music have long exposed enthusiastic audiences to materials otherwise largely exclusive to worship settings. In this singing school, sample from “ethical arrangements” of music included in the Sounding Spirit Digital Library. Professor of Choral Music and Associate Dean for Graduate Studies and Creative Endeavors at Michigan State University, Derrick Fox will lead this session.</p>
