      <p align="center">Updated February 25, 2026</p>

      <p>Atlanta Sacred Harp Singing Update March 2026</p>

      <p>Note change in date for the monthly Emory Presbyterian singing….2nd Thursday instead of 1st Thursday for March.</p>

      <p>The Athens area “Teenth Tuesday” monthly singing starts back on the 17th.</p>

      <p>Two items that might be of interest:</p>

      <p>
        Atlanta Interfaith Broadcasters (AIB) are looking to feature Sacred Harp on their “Sacred Sounds and Spaces” program — planned to air in mid-April.
        There are likely to be film crews at the two upcoming local singings (Emory Pres on Thursday, March 12th, the Grant Park singing on Monday, March 16th,
        and at the State Convention in Dahlonega on March 21st and 22nd). I've passed along some of your emails as potential interviewees, if someone reaches
        out to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pbXPbSPtsWw?si=VTfo2FLmXNQnfoTJ" target="_blank">Here's one of their previous shows.</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        Georgia Public Broadcasters (GPB) are planning to air a radio program on the United Convention and the debut of the 2025 Revision on Friday, March 20th
        at 2pm (timed to coincide with the state convention that weekend.)
