      <h1>August 2025 Singings</h1>

      <p align="center">Updated July 29, 2025</p>

      <p> Atlanta Sacred Harp August 2025 Atlanta Sacred Harp Singing Reminder</p>

      <p>Hello All,</p>

      <p>Some notes and requests in regards to the upcoming <a href="https://originalsacredharp.com/debut-singing-from-the-sacred-harp-2025-edition/" target="_blank">debut</a> of the 2025 revision of the Sacred Harp.</p>

      <p>We are expecting some media coverage in the run-up to the debut of the book at the convention in September. There has been some interest from the local ABC folks to come to one of the local singings in Augustâ€”either Emory Presbyterian on the 1st Thursday (7th) or the Pine Lake singing on the 3rd Wednesday (20th). It would be good to have a good turnout of singers at both of these&hellip;if you don't normally come, please consider coming and singing at either (or both) of those dates. Details below.</p>

      <p>Due to the large crowd expected at the convention, singers are being asked to register. If you are planning on attending, please use <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdw3vTOtgwqKe8RmNmdYJaj9swkv-rlZt0zJF_IAmQdzX96Cw/viewform" target="_blank">this link</a> to do so. (Note, the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/revising-the-sacred-harp-symposium-tickets-1497680876819?aff=oddtdtcreator&fbclid=IwY2xjawL2A5hleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFmakRBaVNIYmhRRWNmM0diAR5AtFn39Fstw3ilLv2iU43jI7ne3-lu3RtQP8r7CT0_SFOZBijKR4HsMp2X1Q_aem_eRGQmcAfTy9KEcrS-bm7aw" target="_blank">symposium</a> on Friday is already sold out, but there is a waitlist)</p>

      <p>There are still opportunities to host visiting singers:</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>Hi, Friends! Just a reminder that we are hosting the United Convention and 2025 Sacred Harp Revision Debut singing on September 13-14 (not to mention a day-long symposium on the revision process on Friday September 12 at Emory). Some folks would really love to come but housing in Atlanta, as we all know, is not cheap. </p>

      <p>Hosting travelers is a time-honored tradition in Sacred Harp and can be really fun. I know many of you probably already have full houses for the United, but if you have some space to share for at least Saturday and Sunday, please fill out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Jk1VoQehnr_t1nhWxSpnGwgtia9x480njp2pLwcYemM/viewform?ts=686bf84a&edit_requested=true" target="_blank">"housing to offer" form</a> and Lauren Bock and I will try to match up singers with appropriate hosts. Lots of the folks who really need housing are young and would be thrilled with a couch or even a space on the floor to roll out a sleeping bag.</p>

      <p>So far, we have only had two folks fill out the form. If you have been meaning to, now would be a great time to do so. It's not that long and your space doesn't have to be fancy.</p>

      <p>Thanks for helping to maintain our reputation for hospitality!</p>

      <p>Lisa</p>
