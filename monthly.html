      <p>This is a two-room schoolhouse built in the late 19th century, now a site for traditional music performances and jams. (See <a href="https://www.facebook.com/oolenoybluegrass/">their Facebook page</a> for pictures.) The address is 5301 Dacusville Hwy, Pickens, SC 29671. It is about 13 miles north of Easley, SC on SC Hwy 135, although those traveling from the north or west may want to access it from Scenic Hwy 11. (Check Google Maps for detailed directions.)  PLEASE NOTE: The Oolenoy Community House (OCH) is located on SC Hwy 135, one-half mile from its northern terminus at SC Hwy 8. The bridge on Hwy 135 between Hwy 8 and the OCH is out. If you are driving on Hwy 135 from the south (from Easley), just ignore any "bridge out" or "road closed" signs, and proceed as usual to the OCH. If you are driving on Hwy 8, instead of turning onto Hwy 135 do the following: At the intersection of Hwy 8 and Hwy 288 in Pumpkintown, turn so that you pass in front of the Dollar General store. At 1.1 miles from the intersection, turn right on Miracle Hill Road. Follow that 1.1 miles to the OCH. The building has a refrigerator, oven, and microwave. We encourage everyone to be responsible for their own well-being and to be considerate of the other participants. Don't come if you have Covid symptoms or if you think you may have been exposed recently. We will have hand sanitizer, anti-bacterial soap, and disposable food service gloves available for the safety of all singers and visitors. For more information, please contact Dave Farmer at davefarmer-at-charter-dot-net. You may also call me at (864) 676-9003 (home) or (864) 605-8236 (cell). Please join us May 10th in metropolitan Pumpkintown!</p>
