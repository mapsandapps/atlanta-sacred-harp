        <h1>Historical Minutes of Atlanta-Area Singings</h1>

        <p>Included below are the minutes of many Atlanta-area Denson Sacred Harp singings before 1995. Minutes from 1995 to the present are readily available on <a href="https://fasola.org/minutes/" target="_blank">fasola.org</a>, so I have not gone to the trouble of including them here.</p>

        <p>Misspellings, typos, etc. have been retained from the originals. Hopefully I have not introduced any new errors in the process of transcribing. For some years, we have been unable to find the minutes of these singings. If you happen to know where to find any of those, please <a href="mailto:mail@atlantasacredharp.org?subject=Sacred Harp website - historical minutes">send us an email</a>.</p>

        <p>Thanks to the Sacred Harp Museum for letting me peruse their old minutes books, and thanks to Andy Ditzler for helping me find & photograph the relevant minutes within them. —Shawn Taylor</p>

            lesson was held. This past March at the Grogia State Convention, during the memorial lesson, Hugh McGraw made a point of reminding us that we must
            face the fact that Sacred Harp music is dying out - at least in this part of the county. With this in mind, the memorial tributes that we hold for our
            loved ones become more and more heart wrenching. Death is truly multi-faceted. This morning we sang the song that says, " Death is the gate of endless
            joy and yet we dread to enter there". We, through our love, and our selfishness; however, desparately cling to our relatives and friends, until
            finally our Lord calls each one home, leaving us with the precious memories. The acknowledgement of these memories is why the memorial lesson is such
            an integral part of the Sacred Harp Convention. Mary Lou Cagle read the names of the deceased. Bonnie Flowers then read a poem by Thomas Moore
            Entitled " Tis the Last Rose of Summer" and called attention to the solitary rose in a bouquet of Carnations. Kenneth DeLong led song on page 341 for

            following: "Come let us join our friends above. That have obtained the prize. And on the eagle wings of love, To Joy celestial rise. Let all the
            saints terrestrial sing, with those to glory gone. For all the servants of our King. In Heaven and earth are one. One family we dwell in him. One
            church above beneath. Though now divided by the stream, the narrow stream of death. One army of the living God. To his command we bow. Part of the
            host have crossed the flood, And part are crossing now." We have been fortunate that since our session at Ebenezer Church last year, we have only five
            names on our list - Ruby DeLong, Mollie Cochran, Aaron Wright, D.T. White and Jim Ayers. We feel sad when those we love are touched by death's dark
            hand, but it would ease our sorrow more if we could but understand that death is just a gateway that all men must pass through; and on the other side
            of death, is a world that's bright and new. Our loved ones wait to welcome us to a land that's free from tears, where joy becomes eternal and time is
            not counted by years. Kenneth DeLong led songs on pages 75b, 114 and 410. We want to remember our shut- ins William Headrick and Ellavee Mann. Jesse
            Roberts led song on page 454 for them. Daniel Hudson closed the memorial lesson with prayer.
