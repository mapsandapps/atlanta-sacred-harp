      <h1>Transportation From Atlanta To Camp Fasola Via Airport Shuttle</h1>

      <p>Every year, <a href="https://campfasola.org/" target="_blank">Camp Fasola</a> brings many shape note singers through Atlanta. We are often asked how to get from Atlanta to Camp without renting a car. The <a href="https://groometransportation.com/birmingham/" target="_blank">Groome airport shuttle</a> is one option. It can be a bit tricky to find out about this option and how to book it, so we've created this page to help.</p>

      <h2>Steps to Book & Catch the Shuttle</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>Go to the page for the <a href="https://groometransportation.com/birmingham/" target="_blank">Birmingham-ATL Groome airport shuttle</a>. Here you can find up-to-date info about fares, the schedule, and where the bus stops in the Anniston/Oxford, Alabama area.</li>
        <li>When booking, be sure to book trips between the ATL airport and the Oxford, Alabama stop. As of June 2025, the shuttle stops at the Holiday Inn Express & Suites in Oxford, Alabama. Note that Alabama is in a different time zone than Georgia.</li>
        <li>When you arrive at the Atlanta airport, be sure to check any messages you have received from Groome, but generally what you will do is follow signs within the airport directing you to MARTA & ground transportation, exit via door W-2 (on the south terminal side) or door W-1 (north terminal side). Out these doors, you can find ground transportation spaces 4-8, which the shuttle will depart from. <a href="https://groometransportation.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/20240422-ATL-FindUs-Map@2x.png" target="_blank">Here's a graphic</a> from Groome that shows where to go. There are several Groome shuttles that depart from here â€” the one to Oxford, Alabama will say "Birmingham" on it.</li>
        <li>When your shuttle arrives, you'll check in with the driver, give them your name, and hand them any larger luggage. At this time, you'll want to check that the driver knows you're going to Oxford, Alabama. The stop in Oxford is by appointment only; if no passengers are getting on or off there, they will skip it and go straight to Birmingham.</li>
        <li>Disembark at the stop in Oxford. From here, it's 5 miles to Camp Lee, where Camp Fasola is held. You can catch a rideshare (Uber, Lyft, etc.) or may be able to coordinate a ride with another camp attendee. You may also be able to <a href="https://campfasola.org/frequently-asked-questions/#:~:text=we%20could%20do%20pickup%20to%20Camp%20Lee" target="_blank">coordinate with Camp Fasola directly</a>. The address for Camp Lee is 70 Hidden Valley Rd, Anniston, AL 36207. GPS: 33.651381, -85.754427</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Other Info</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>If you are not flying in and out of Atlanta but arriving at the airport by other means (e.g. MARTA), you can put "South Terminal" as your "airline or terminal." Then when you arrive back in Atlanta, you'll get dropped off at the airport's south terminal. From there, it's easy to get to MARTA or other ground transportation.</li>
        <li>International flights: If you are flying into the ATL international terminal, when you arrive, you'll have to go to the domestic terminal to catch the shuttle. You'll want to allocate some additional time for this. Information is provided on the <a href="https://groometransportation.com/faq/" target="_blank">Groome website</a>.</li>
