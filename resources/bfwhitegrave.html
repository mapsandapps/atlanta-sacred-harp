      <p>
        Benjamin Franklin White was born in South Carolina in 1800. He married Thurza Golightly in 1825, and they had nine children. They moved to Georgia in
        1842.
      </p>

      <p>
        B. F. White and Elisha J. King transcribed, and composed tunes, compiling them into <i>The Sacred Harp</i>, which they published in 1844. King died
        shortly after the book was initially published, and White continued to revise the book and publish subsequent editions throughout his life.
      </p>

      <p>White retired to DeKalb County, Georgia and died in 1879 following a fall on the street. He was buried in Oakland Cemetery in Atlanta.</p>

      <h2>Graves</h2>

      <p>As well as B. F. White and his wife Thurza, some of their family are also buried at Oakland Cemetery or in the metro Atlanta area:</p>

      <p>The White family plot is at Section 4 Block 125.</p>

      <p>Their son William Decatur White is buried nearby at Section 4 Block 118 Lot 4N.</p>

      <p>Their children Robert H White and Mary Caroline “Carrie” (White) Adair were twins, b. 1831 in South Carolina.</p>

      <p>Robert's gravestone is visible near his parents.</p>

      <p>
        Carrie married an Alabama lawyer, William Adair. They had one daughter before he died early. Carrie moved back to Georgia, and taught insturmental music
        in the Atlanta area. She and her daughter are likely also buried with her family at Oakland Cemetery, but the grave is not marked.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nancy Ogburn “Nannie” (White) Byrd's gravestone is visible near her parents. She was an accomplished leader of Sacred Harp music, and all her children
        were musicians.

      <p>

      <h2>Accessibility Information</h2>

      <p>
        There are some accessible parking spots available in front of the visitor center. Most of the route to the grave is well-paved. There is a cobblestone
        section at the entrance. The last couple cemetery blocks before reaching the grave are the most challenging. They include dirt and grass sections,
        including a brick gutter that must be navigated through.
      </p>

      <p>Note that it is often possible to drive into the cemetery along the paved paths and park near the gravesite.</p>
