      </p>

      <p>
        King Memorial MARTA station is near the cemetery — about a 7-minute walk to the entrance. From the station, go south on Grant Street and then east on MLK Dr to reach the visitors center and main cemetery gate entrance.
      </p>

      <h2>Finding the Grave</h2>

      <p>
        B.F. White's grave is about a five-minute walk from the main Oakland Cemetery parking lot, or about a twelve-minute walk from King Memorial MARTA station.</p>

        <h2>Accessibility Information</h2>

        <p>There are some accessible parking spots available in front of the visitor center. Most of the route to the grave is well-paved. There is a cobblestone section at the entrance. The last couple cemetery blocks before reaching the grave are the most challenging. They include dirt and grass sections, including a brick gutter that must be navigated through.</p>
