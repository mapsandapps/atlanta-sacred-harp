	   <p>There are several local shape-note singing groups in Georgia 
	   that meet four or more times a year for about 2 hours at a time.  These singings are less formal than all-day singings.  Since they meet frequently and tend to 
	   attract the same group of people each time, they offer an especially comfortable environment for practicing 
	   singing and leading skills.  Newcomers are always welcome.  
       </p>
       <p>Be aware that locations can change and singings can be rescheduled or cancelled.  Check our <a href="monthly.html">upcoming singings page</a> for the latest information.

	   <H2 align = "left">Decatur Monthly Shape Note Singing</h2>
	   <!-- worded like this to match the newspaper announcments -->
	   <p>Our informal First Thursday singing 
	   is a good place for beginners in the Atlanta area to learn this 
	   style of music. We begin at 7:30 pm.
	   Participants take turns choosing songs from the <i>Sacred Harp</i> (1991 ed.) until 8:30.  During a short break for refreshments, we pass
	   out copies of <i>An Eclectic Harmony</i>, a shape note sampler book that includes several beloved late 19th century 
	   hymns.  Singing continues from both books until 9:30.
	   Songbooks are available to borrow, buy, or share.
