      <h2>Singing Workshop</h2>

      <p>This three-night participatory workshop is for all those interested in learning to sing in a friendly, non-performance environment. No prior musical experience or skill set is needed. Just bring your voice! You'll learn the basics of melody and harmony singing, get practice reading music using traditional shape note symbols, and discover a rich body of American folk hymns.</p>
      
      <p>We'll delve into the music of The Sacred Harp, a tunebook first published in the 1840s and still in print today. Sacred Harp songs are known for their distinctive, haunting harmonies and powerful expression, and have influenced classic artists like the Carter Family, and contemporary practitioners like T Bone Burnett, Bonnie “Prince” Billy, and Sam Amidon.</p>

      <p>The workshop is free and open to anyone. Beginners and the "just curious" are welcome. Each session is taught by an experienced Sacred Harp singer and begins with a brief introduction for complete beginners, followed by a detailed lesson on different aspects of shape note singing. We'll talk a little about the deep history of the music, but our workshop will emphasize practice: learning the mechanics of reading music and singing, how to keep time, what to expect at “all-day” Sacred Harp singings, and more. There will be plenty of opportunity to ask questions, as well as a break with snacks.</p>
      
      <p>While each session will cover a different aspect of singing, we'll also begin each time with a refresher on the basics, so you can come for all three sessions or join at any point.</p>

      <p>Come learn a deep American musical tradition, build confidence, and connect with others through a shared passion for singing!</p>

      <p><strong>David Ivey</strong> is a country singing school teacher and lifelong Sacred Harp singer. He is co-founder and director of Camp Fasola, a summer camp for teaching Sacred Harp music and traditions. David was recipient of the National Endowment for the Arts prestigious National Heritage Fellowship award in 2013. He serves as Chair of the Revision-Music Committee for The Sacred Harp, 1991 Edition, which will be its sixth revision since 1844. He considers his participation in all-day and local singings to be his most important activity in Sacred Harp.</p>

      <p><strong>Sasha Hsuczyk</strong> is a musician and music teacher based in Pine Lake, Georgia. She was raised in Los Angeles, CA and Kaneohe, Hawaii by a multicultural Asian and Irish American family that nurtured her love of music and cultural heritage. She studied at the University of Limerick and Hampshire College, graduating with a certificate in ethnomusicology. Her love of traditional Irish music led her to develop a passion for related and parallel traditions like Sacred Harp singing, old time music, and Cajun and Creole music. She has been an avid Sacred Harp singer for over 15 years and was the pilot intern at the Sacred Harp Museum in Carrollton, GA. She is also a teacher and counselor at Camp Fasola in Anniston, AL, and has taught singing schools in various regions around the US and abroad. She loves to share about her theories on accent, rhythm, and how to sing harmoniously together as a collective, inspired by historic recordings as well as modern traditional approaches to Sacred Harp singing.</p>

      <p><strong>Andy Ditzler</strong> is an experienced practitioner of traditional Sacred Harp singing and has taught shape note music in cities throughout the United States, in Canada, France, Camp Fasola in Alabama, and Camp Fasola in Poland.</p>
