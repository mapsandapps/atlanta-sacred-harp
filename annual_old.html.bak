      <h1>Annual Singings in Georgia</h1>

      <p>
        Annual singings are the best place to experience Sacred Harp. They might be big or small, old (over 150 years) or new. Most annual singings are all-day
        singings with dinner at noon. They usually start at 9:30 or 10:00 AM. They end around 2:30 or 3:00, after everyone who wants to lead a song has had a
        turn. Newcomers are always welcome.
      </p>
      <p>
        The list of singings below is generated from Warren Steel's
        <a href="http://www.mcsr.olemiss.edu/~mudws/annual.html">annual Sacred Harp directory</a> and
        <a href="http://home.olemiss.edu/~mudws/charmony.html">annual Christian Harmony directory</a>. Sometimes singings change or are cancelled at the last
        minute. Up-to-date confirmed information, with details and directions, is given each month on our <a href="monthly.html">upcoming singings page</a>.

        <!-- For the dates of Sundays this year, refer to our <a href="calendar.html">calendar page</a>.-->
      </p>

      <p>
        Of special note is the multi-book extravaganza on the weekend of the 4th Sunday in February, starting at Hardeman Primitive Baptist in Decatur, then
        moving to the Hollingsworths' house in Ila Saturday evening, then concluding on Sunday at the UGA Botanical Garden in Athens.
