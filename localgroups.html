        There are several local shape-note singing groups in Georgia that meet four or more times a year for about 2 hours at a time. These singings are less
        formal than all-day singings. Since they meet frequently and tend to attract the same group of people each time, they offer an especially comfortable
        environment for practicing singing and leading skills. Newcomers are always welcome.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be aware that locations can change and singings can be rescheduled or cancelled. Check our <a href="monthly.html">upcoming singings page</a> for the
        latest information.

      <!-- worded like this to match the newspaper announcments -->
      <p>
        Our informal First Thursday singing is a good place for beginners in the Atlanta area to learn this style of music. We meet the first Thursday of each
        month from 7:00 to 9:00 pm in the Emory Presbyterian Church fellowship building,
        <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/WtQMMfAuvCeWkQrc8" target="_blank">1886 North Decatur Road, Atlanta, GA 30307</a>. We sing from The Sacred Harp and the
        Eclectic Harmony. Loaner books available.
