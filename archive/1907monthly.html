<h1>July 2019 Singings</h1>

<p align = "center">Updated June 26, 2019</p>

<p>

Sacred Harp Singings are free and open to the public. All are welcome (including children of all ages). The only requirement for singing Sacred Harp is the desire to sing Sacred Harp. This is a participatory style of singing, not a concert or performance, so you are always welcome (and encouraged!) to join in. An offering is usually taken to defray expenses. 

</p><p>

For “All-Day” singings:
</p><p>
There will be a Dinner on the Grounds around noon (potluck) unless otherwise noted. Please stay and eat even if you didn’t bring food. There is always enough to go around. 

</p><p>

Singing start times are noted, but end times vary depending on how many singers/leaders attend. You can usually expect “All-Day” singings to end between 2:00 and 3:00 pm.

</p><p>

All singings are from The Sacred Harp 1991 edition unless otherwise noted. For Google maps for all these singings, please see the links on the pages for <a href="annual.html">annual singings</a>, <a href="localgroups.html">local groups</a> or <a href="notesing.html">note singings</a>.

July promises to be an excellent singing month, starting with the “Fourth of July” singing (on July 1 this year) at Camp Fasola (Youth). Their Community Singing will be on the evening of the 4th of July.

</p><p>

1st Thursday and 2nd Tuesday singings are joining forces this month! Don’t miss our 3rd Annual “Christmas in July” evening singing on July 11.

</p><p>

Always wanted to sing at Spivey Hall? You’ll have your chance on July 20.

</p><p>

2nd Tuesday Singings at Holy Trinity return in August (with childcare!) Stay tuned.

</p><p>

I’ve sent a separate email already about the revision of the Sacred Harp that is underway. If you didn’t see it, please check your email inbox and read it for interesting/exciting news! 

</p><p>

Sing On! Lisa
