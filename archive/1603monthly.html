<p align = "center">Updated March 17, 2016</p>

<br>
<p><font color = "red">Update:</font> Fixed a bug that hid some singings from March 17-23. Also, note that the Biweekly singing is moved from St. John the Wonderworker on March 23 because of church activities during Orthodox Lent. </p>

<p>Help out with the Chantlanta singing demonstration Mar. 12, check out the new "Songs Abound" singing  Mar. 14,  and the Georgian Harmony singing on the afternoon on Mar. 20 at Hardeman, and support your local singings, old and new, big and small!  
Here's a message from John Plunkett about the Ga. State Convention (at Big Creek, Mar. 26 and 27):
</p><p>
HELP NEEDED!<br>
With the Georgia State Convention coming up at the end of the month, we are starting to get a good number of requests for hospitality (ie-putting people up for a few nights!!).  These tend to be younger singers, who would like come sing with us, but may not really have the disposable income for a hotel.   If you have a spare room, sofa, place to put a sleeping bag, etc - please let us know.  Even if you weren't going to be able to attend the convention (it is Easter weekend), but can house someone, we can work out transportation options if needed.    You can contact John Plunkett, bildad12 at hotmail dot com or Lauren Bock, fasolauren -at- gmail -dot- com.  Thanks in advance.
</p><p>
Registration is open for Camp Fasola.  You can find the dates and places for Adult Camp, Youth Camp, and Europe Camp and register here:  <a href="http://campfasola.org/">http://campfasola.org/</a>.

At each Songs Abound event we sing new compositions in the Sacred Harp style by local and international composers, and a guest leader will teach an extended lesson from an alternate tune book. Songs Abound events are an enjoyable way to improve our sight-reading skills, allow composers to hear their tunes, and deepen our knowledge of Sacred Harp singing. 

This is the first Songs Abound session. In the first half we will sing new compositions. In the second half, guest leader Lauren Bock will teach an extended lesson from the Northern Harmony.
