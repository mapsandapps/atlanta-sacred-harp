    <p>Note: This Google Calendar is an experiment. Currently, the only events included will be the singings in the most recent newsletter and regular local singings within the state (<a href="mailto:mail@atlantasacredharp.org?subject=Sacred%20Harp%20website%20msg">let us know</a> if you want your local singing to be included.) In other words, this calendar does not currently include singings that are months in advance.</p>
