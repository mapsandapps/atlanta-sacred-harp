<h1>2021 Singings</h1>

<p align = "center">Updated April 6, 2021</p>

<p>
Happy Spring Everyone!
</p><p>
Some April updates:
</p><ul>
<li>State Line Singing (Saturday before the 2nd Sunday is cancelled.</li>
<li>Middle Georgia Singing (Saturday before the 3rd Sunday) is cancelled.</li>
<li>Atlanta All Day Singing (Saturday before the 4th Sunday) is cancelled.</li>
</ul><p>
All 3 of these expect to meet in 2022 (circumstances permitting).
</p><p>
MARK YOUR CALENDARS!!
</p><p>
We are tentatively planning to hold on OUTSIDE singing in May.

Haygood Memorial UMC has an outdoor plaza area that should work well as a place to meet and sing.  (They have been having some of their services in this area).

We plan to meet on Sunday, May 23rd, 5:30pm-7:30pm.
</p><p>
More details in May, but in the interim - get your shots when you are eligible!!
