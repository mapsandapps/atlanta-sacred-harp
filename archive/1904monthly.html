Lastly, you might be interested in this performance which uses some shape-note songs, and is coming up soon (Palm Sunday afternoon) here in Atlanta:



Southern Folk Passion - Sunday, April 14, 2019, 4:00 PM,

 

The Church at Ponce and Highland, 1080 Ponce de Leon Ave., NE, Atlanta, Georgia 30306.

 

Brenda Bynum, the Meridian Chorale, and Steven Darsey, via historic shape-note folk tunes, present this dramatic portrayal of the Passion of Christ.

 

The Passion of Christ has been central to the life experience of southern people. Their love and empathy is well recorded in the heartfelt strains of their songs. Singing from their experience, this unique Passion service is built around folk hymns from the famous 19th century <i>The Sacred Harp</i> tunebook, compiled in Georgia in 1844.
