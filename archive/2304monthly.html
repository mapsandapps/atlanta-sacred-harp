Apr. 8, Saturday before the 2nd Sunday, 10:00am (ET). The State Line singing will be held on the Saturday before the 2nd Sunday in April, April 8, at 9:00 CT, 10:00 ET. However, for this year only, circumstances dictate that we hold the singing at Holly Springs Church in Bremen, GA, instead of at State Line.

Due to lack of use during the Covid years, there are repairs that need to be made to State Line Church in order to make it usable for an April singing in Alabama. We really appreciate the generosity of Judy Henry and her family for allowing us to use Holly Springs on such short notice. We do, however, plan on having the singing at State Line next year. We hope to see you there. Please bring a covered dish for lunch.
