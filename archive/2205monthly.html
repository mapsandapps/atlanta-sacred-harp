May 7th - Saturday before the 2nd Sunday - The Pumpkintown Shape Note Singing (formerly the Furman University Singing) will be held on the Saturday before the second Sunday in May, from 10am until 3pm, at the Oolenoy Community House. We will sing from the Sacred Harp (1991) and the Christian Harmony (2010). We will celebrate our return to singing with a traditional dinner-on-the-grounds.
</p><p>
This will be our first year singing in this location, a two-room schoolhouse built in the late 19th century, now a site for traditional music performances and jams. (See their Facebook page for pictures: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/oolenoybluegrass/">https://www.facebook.com/oolenoybluegrass/</a>.) The address is 5301 Dacusville Hwy, Pickens, SC 29671. It is about 13 miles north of Easley, SC on SC Hwy 135, although those traveling from the north or west may want to access it from Scenic Hwy 11. (Check Google Maps for detailed directions.) The building has a refrigerator, oven, and microwave.
</p><p>
We encourage everyone to be responsible for their own well-being and to be considerate of the other participants. Don’t come if you have Covid symptoms or if you think you may have been exposed recently. We will have hand sanitizer, anti-bacterial soap, and disposable food service gloves available for the safety of all singers and visitors.
</p><p>
For more information, please contact me at davefarmer-at-charter-dot-net. You may also call me at (864) 676-9003 (home) or (864) 605-8236 (cell). Please join us May 7 in metropolitan Pumpkintown!

Very sad to relay this news:  

"After many decades, it is with great sadness that we announce the permanent cancellation of the DeLong-Roberts Memorial Sacred Harp Singing held the 4th Sunday in June.  We appreciate all the love and support you have shown our singing over the years and we will always remember the joyful singing and wonderful fellowship we've enjoyed.  Thank you from the DeLong and Roberts families."

                         — Janice DeLong Paulk and Jesse Roberts, Jr
