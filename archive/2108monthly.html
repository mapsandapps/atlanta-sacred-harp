<h1>August 2021 Singings</h1>

<p align = "center">Updated August 11, 2021</p>

<p>
    <font color = "red">Update: </font> Due to the current surge in Covid-19 cases and the associated impact, the 3rd Sunday singing at Haygood Memorial UMC is cancelled for August (this coming Sunday). We will tentatively plan to reconvene 3rd Sunday in September. Please get your vaccine shot(s) if you haven't already done so!!
</p><p>
Given the recent uptick in covid cases associated with the Delta variant, some of our medical folks have come up with the following guidelines for singings for the upcoming weeks/months:
</p><p>
"Keep no longer at a distance" (well, maybe for just a while longer) ...
</p><p>
This is a joint message from Amy Armstrong Wells and me (David Brodeur). In Atlanta we have been meeting twice a month for unmasked outdoor singing. We feel it's important to announce clear expectations for COVID precautions going forward. We hope that our healthcare and singing experience, along with our service organizing these singings will speak for themselves.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Atlanta singings are only open to fully vaccinated singers, whether indoors or outdoors.</li>

<li>Masking is not required, though anyone is free to wear a mask if they wish.</li>

<li>Fully vaccinated but high-risk singers (e.g., over 75, immune-compromised) are advised to avoid indoor events, and to mask and distance at outdoor events.</li>

<li>During periods of substantial to high transmission in our area, indoor events are suspended. Depending on the level of risk, outdoor events may also be suspended.</li>

<li>Children too young to be vaccinated (currently under 12) should not attend indoor events. At outdoor events, these children should maintain their distance from the square unless they are masked. For example, they could mask and enter briefly to lead a song.</li>
    
</ul>

<p>
We intend that, going forward, these guidelines will govern our First Thursday and Third Sunday singings. Atlanta singers can contact one of us privately.
</p><p>
We'll be singing outdoors as planned this Thursday, 5-Aug, 7:00 PM at the Emory Presbyterian Church Prayer Garden.
