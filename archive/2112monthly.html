Or feel free to bring copies to pass out of any holiday song (written in 4-shapes) you'd like to sing. We'll enjoy a holiday snack break, so bring something to share, if you can.

Looking forward to singing with you soon!! <a href="https://fb.me/e/1gM4ZiYw3">https://fb.me/e/1gM4ZiYw3</a>

Covid guidelines for Atlanta singings:
<ul>
<li>Atlanta singings are only open to fully vaccinated singers, whether indoors or outdoors.</li>

<li>Masking is not required, though anyone is free to wear a mask if they wish.</li>

<li>Fully vaccinated but high-risk singers (e.g., over 75, immune-compromised) are advised to avoid indoor events, and to mask and distance at outdoor events.</li>

<li>During periods of substantial to high transmission in our area, indoor events are suspended. Depending on the level of risk, outdoor events may also be suspended.</li>

<li>Children too young to be vaccinated (currently under 5) should not attend indoor events. At outdoor events, these children should maintain their distance from the square unless they are masked. For example, they could mask and enter briefly to lead a song.</li>

<li>Singers agree to participate in contact tracing, should it become necessary.   </li> 
</ul>
