<h1>December 2018 Singings</h1>

<p align = "center">Updated November 29, 2018</p>

<p>
Hark!  singing is in the air this month and shape-note singing fills the halls like no other.  Share your voice with friends at one of these fine singings.

 </p><p> 

Note:  No "First Thursday" singing at Emory Presbyterian - instead we will have the Christmas singing and potluck supper at Church of Our Saviour  in Virginia Highlands, December 16.  Also note different location for the Florida State Singing Convention (Cooper Book) this year.  We have a couple of Florida singings particularly for those folks looking for an excuse to seek warmer climes now that cold winds have found their way to Atlanta.
 </p><p>

John Plunkett is still looking for singers who can sing for the "Candlelight Nights" event at Atlanta History Center on December 14th and 21st, at 7 and 8 p.m.  Contact him, bildad12- at- hotmail -dot- com, 470-230-5757, if you can help with this - it should be a merry time outdoors and with cider to warm you.

 </p><p> 

See the note about the January 12 singing school also under "Upcoming Singings" and come if you can.
