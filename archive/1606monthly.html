June 3, Fri.,  Songs Abound singing at home of David Brodeur and Andy Ditzler.  7:00 p.m.  Songs Abound is an occasional series of singings in Atlanta, featuring new compositions in the Sacred Harp style by local and international composers, a historical Sacred Harp lesson, and extended lessons from alternate tune books. Songs Abound events are an enjoyable way to improve our sight-reading skills, allow composers to hear their tunes, and deepen our knowledge of shape note singing. 
The second Songs Abound will begin with a look at Sacred Harp 505 (Where Ceaseless Ages Roll), in its quite different original version as published in the 1960 Sacred Harp. We will sing new compositions by Stanley Smith (Ozark, Alabama), Ryan Bowman (Cantonment, FL), and Tom George (Fyffe, Alabama). In the second half, our guest singing master Lauren Bock will present an extended lesson of tunes from the Northern Harmony, a tunebook of historic and contemporary compositions.  Please contact andy -at- andyditzler dot com for address and directions.
