<h1>October 2019 Singings</h1>

<p align = "center">Updated October 18, 2019</p>

<p>

Sacred Harp Singings are free and open to the public. All are welcome (including children of all ages). The only requirement for singing Sacred Harp is the desire to sing Sacred Harp. This is a participatory style of singing, not a concert or performance, so you are always welcome (and encouraged!) to join in. An offering is usually taken to defray expenses. 


</p><p>

For “All-Day” singings:
</p><p>
There will be a Dinner on the Grounds around noon (potluck) unless otherwise noted. Please stay and eat even if you didn’t bring food. There is always enough to go around. 

</p><p>

Singing start times are noted, but end times vary depending on how many singers/leaders attend. You can usually expect “All-Day” singings to end between 2:00 and 3:00 pm.

</p><p>

All singings are from The Sacred Harp 1991 edition unless otherwise noted. For Google maps for all these singings, please see the links on the pages for <a href="annual.html">annual singings</a>, <a href="localgroups.html">local groups</a> or <a href="notesing.html">note singings</a>. For easier reading of the listings, driving directions for most singings have been moved to the bottom of this page.

</p><p>

NEW!!!! If you need a ride or would like to carpool, please email me, Lisa Bennett, at AtlantaSinging -at- gmail -dot- com or text me at 404-402-9562, and we will see if we can start matching up more singers to carpool to singings. In your message please say your name, which singing you want to go to, and where you live. Also, if you have access to MARTA, what station or bus lines you are near. THIS IS A TEST and I have no idea how it will work out, but let’s try to save some gas, help some car-less singers or people like me who hate to drive distances, and have some fun and fellowship while we’re at it. IF YOU HAVE ROOM in your car or van, and would like to offer a ride, let me know that, too!

Singings List

</h2>

<p><font color = "red">Update: </font> We received the word today that the Tri-State (Cooper Book) Convention that was to take place tomorrow has been cancelled due to inclement weather in the area. 

Hoping & praying all the best for everyone in the area.</p>
<p>
Cooler weather is coming, as are some great singings. 

</p><p>

Please note the Seed & Feed Singing will be held in a *new location* this year. The Northlake  Church of Christ in Tucker will be hosting us in their lovely and acoustically superior fellowship hall. They have held a couple of singing schools there in the past few years and are excited about hosting us. Please come and, if you’re local, bring food! Even better, bring a friend or two AND food.

</p><p>

Don’t forget the Union Convention at Poplar Springs near Bowdon (Carroll County) THIS weekend (Sept 28-29). 

</p><p>

Also, I’m sorry to report that the 3rd Thursday Singings at Holly Springs/Bremen have been suspended until further notice.
</p><p>
Sing on! Lisa
