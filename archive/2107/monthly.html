Note: Please note that if you have not been vaccinated, and you want to come, make sure that you are not running a high fever, you’re not coughing, or you’re not experiencing shortness of breath (SO2 level should be 90 or higher); if so, stay home. If you are symptom-free and have not been vaccinated, we request that you wear a mask at all times (except while eating) and practice social distancing.  The square will be set up with the chairs 8” apart, and we expect you to spread out the same way if you’re sitting on benches. The leader will be 10’ away from the first row of singers (standing on an X on the floor). At lunch, sanitize your hands before you set out your food, and sanitize them at the front of the lunch line before you get your plates, eating utensils, and napkins. Drinks will be poured and handed to you. If you go back for seconds, throw your first plate and utensils away and start the process over. If anyone has a tailgate tent, please bring it; we plan to set up some tailgate tents outside the dining area, so we can distance some while eating.
