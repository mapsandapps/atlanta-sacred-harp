We mourn the loss of our beloved singing friend Rebecca Over, who was the Chair of this convention at the time of her death. In the spirit of Rebecca's diligent stewardship, we will publish a Memorial Lesson during the weekend of this Convention. If you would like to add singers' names to the lists of sick and shut-in or deceased, please contact Andy Ditzler at andy-at-andyditzler-dot-com.
