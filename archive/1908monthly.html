<h1>August 2019 Singings</h1>

<p align = "center">Updated August 19, 2019</p>

<p><font color = "red">Update:</font>  The Christian Harmony singing scheduled for Tues Aug 20 in Athens has been cancelled due to a venue conflict. 
</p>
<p>

Sacred Harp Singings are free and open to the public. All are welcome (including children of all ages). The only requirement for singing Sacred Harp is the desire to sing Sacred Harp. This is a participatory style of singing, not a concert or performance, so you are always welcome (and encouraged!) to join in. An offering is usually taken to defray expenses. 


</p><p>

For “All-Day” singings:
</p><p>
There will be a Dinner on the Grounds around noon (potluck) unless otherwise noted. Please stay and eat even if you didn’t bring food. There is always enough to go around. 

</p><p>

Singing start times are noted, but end times vary depending on how many singers/leaders attend. You can usually expect “All-Day” singings to end between 2:00 and 3:00 pm.

</p><p>

All singings are from The Sacred Harp 1991 edition unless otherwise noted. For Google maps for all these singings, please see the links on the pages for <a href="annual.html">annual singings</a>, <a href="localgroups.html">local groups</a> or <a href="notesing.html">note singings</a>.

Hello, singing family! August has lots of great near and not-quite-so-near-but-totally-worth-the-drive singings. I’d like to call attention in particular to two Singing Conventions, bookending August with great singing: The 167th Session of the Chattahoochee on Aug 3 & 4, and the Lookout Mountain Convention on Aug 24-25. 

</p><p>

Coming up in September, save the dates for both the United Convention at Emory’s Performing Art Studio on Sept 7 & 8, and The Union Musical Sacred Harp Convention on Sept 28 & 29 at Poplar Springs Primitive Baptist, near Bowden GA.

</p><p>

Sing On! Lisa

Driving Directions for All-Day Singings

</h2><h3>

Wilson’s Chapel (for the Chattahoochee)

</h3><p>

Option 1: Take I-20 to Hwy 61, south to Carrollton. Turn left at the 166 bypass (there are 2 places to turn onto 166, take the 2nd turn... it's a big intersection), go about 1 mile and turn left (south) on Old Newnan Road.  Old Newnan will eventually come to a fork and bear to the right, you want to go straight (left) onto Cross Plains Road.  Go past Cross Plains Baptist Church and the old School House; at the 3 way intersection jog slightly to the right and take the dirt road, which is Hutcheson Ferry Road,  Wilson's Chapel is about 100 yards down the dirt road on the left. 

</p><p>

Option 2: I-20W to exit #30/Post Road (just past Douglasville), go south until you get to Highway 166, turn right onto 166... you'll stay on this for a good ways, don't worry about any turns until you get into Carroll County. Look out for Cross Plains-Hulett Road (there is a convenience store on the right), and turn left onto Cross Plains-Hulett Road. It will eventually intersect with Cross Plains Road and when it does, turn left onto Hutcheson Ferry Road (the dirt road).  Wilson's Chapel will be on the left. John's been going this way a few years, thinks it might be a little shorter.

</p><h3>
