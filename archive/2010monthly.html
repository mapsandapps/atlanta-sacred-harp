October 25th, Fourth Sunday - Coweta County Courthouse, Newnan GA. CANCELLED
</p>

<p>
October 31st, Saturday before First Sunday - Denney Memorial - Emmaus Primitive Baptist Church, Carrollton, GA. Info: Philip Denney 770-367-2628  Please contact Philip for details re: precautions.  Here are some of his plans for the singing:  The singing at Emmaus just happens to have available  all the capabilities to make for a very, very safe singing. I think we would require that a maximum of 60 persons be allowed in the building at any given time. In the unlikely event the attendance is greater, then outdoors singing would be the obvious choice. If there is rainy weather AND a large turnout I propose a shortened day with volunteers singing under the pavilion.  Fans to circulate air, hand sanitizer, wear/bring a mask, and he will have a pair of clear plastic shields standing in the leaders square for the safety of leaders.  I think Philip plans to have lunch catered and served, so please contact him if you plan to attend so he can have a head count.
