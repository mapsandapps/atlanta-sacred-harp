<h1>October 2017 Singings</h1>

<p align = "center">Updated September 29, 2017</p>
<p>Fall is arriving on schedule and that nip will be in the air - the best time of year imho to get out to singings near and far.
 </p><p>
--Note:  The SEED AND FEED SINGING will be in a DIFFERENT LOCATION this year!  Because our regular site is unavailable, we will enjoy the hospitality of the Hardeman Primitive Baptist Church for this singing on October 21.  Everyone please come! 
 </p><p>
--Also note:  Chattanooga singing on the 3rd Thursday is moving to The Well, same address, one door down.
 </p><p>
--As always, singings are from the 1991 Sacred Harp unless otherwise noted.
