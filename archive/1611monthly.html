 Nov 9 -  Singing school taught by Justin Bowen, Georgia Mountain Unitarian Universalist Church in Dahlonega, Georgia. 5:30-8:15.  The singing school is open to the public and will draw a mix of community members and students in a class on the history of religion in Appalachia at University of North Georgia. It would be great to have the support of any Sacred Harp singers who are free this Wednesday night to help these newcomers learn to sing. We will start with the rudiments and move on to learning and singing songs from the Sacred Harp as the singing school progresses—so if some of you are only able to make it by 6:30 or 7:00, your presence would still be more than welcome. This is also an opportunity for any on this list who would like to attend a singing school to do so in scenic Dahlonega! Hope to see many of you Wednesday night. Directions to the church: From GA 400 you come up Crown Mtn. (not a real big one) and crest it right above the town. When you come down to the town you will encounter a traffic light at Morrison Moore Pkwy. (a.k.a. the bypass).  Turn right at the light and immediately turn left on to Park St.  The UU Church is the first building on the left; you will easily see it from the light. The church's address is 439 South Park Street, Dahlonega, GA 30533.
