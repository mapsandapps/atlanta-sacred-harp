<p align = "center">Updated September 14, 2016</p>

<br>
<p><font color = "red">Update (Sept. 14):</font>  The Atlanta Bi-weekly singing tonight will be held at Church of our Saviour, 7pm - 9pm instead of St. John's Orthodox Church in Grant Park. (see directions below).   Dan Brittain is in town and will be joining us tonight....so come sing with Dan!!
</p>
<p>Update (Sept. 1): Due to the <a href="http://www.hendersonandsons.com/sitemaker/sites/HENDER3/obit.cgi?user=01472815_BSmith">funeral for B.M. Smith</a> on Saturday, we will cancel the Georgian Harmony singing in Roberta, as a number of the regular singers that might come to Roberta are planning to go sing for the funeral in Rome. 
</p>
<p>Starting off with a message from John Plunkett:
 </p><p>
Sacred Harp Program - SINGERS NEEDED!!
  </p><p>
We've been invited to participate in the release of a new book, Historic Rural Churches of Georgia, published by UGA Press and The Historical Rural Churches of Georgia Association (and I've accepted!).   I've seen a copy of the book - it's very well done.   This program will mark the 'debut' of the book.   
The program will be on Friday, October 7th at Powelton Methodist Church near Sparta, GA starting at about 1:00PM and lasting about an hour, and will occur in the middle of a tour of some of the churches featured in the book.  We'll sing for about 45 minutes or so.  Here is a link to the church where the program will take place.  <a href="http://hrcga.org/powelton-methodist-hancock-10/">http://hrcga.org/powelton-methodist-hancock-10/</a>
  </p><p>
Being in the middle of the day, I'd like to get a idea of who might be able to help with this.  If you could let me know if you can help with this program by Sept 12th, I would greatly appreciate it.  It's a good opportunity for Sacred Harp exposure to a group that might likely have an interest in singing and in the history of our tradition.  (and there may be similar opportunities in the future).
 </p><p> 
The church is about 1-1/2 hours from the Atlanta area; a little over an hour from Athens and Macon; 2+ hours from the Savannah area.   A good drive for most any of us, but if your schedule permits or you’d be willing to take a vacation day to come help - it would be great to have a good turnout of singers (and it looks like a great space for singing!!).
  </p><p>
Please let me know if you can help with this program or if you have any other questions:
