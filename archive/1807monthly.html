<h1>July 2018 Singings</h1>

<p align = "center">Updated July 9, 2018</p>
<p><font color = "red">Update:</font> The 4th Sunday note singing at The Center had to be cancelled due to damage to the facility.
</p>
<p><font color = "red">Update:</font> Added Facebook link for the Northlake Church of Christ singing on July 22</p>
<p>Whatever the weather, wet or dry, hot or warm, July is a terrific month to go to singings, and we've got lots of them!

</p><p>

Note that the Decatur monthly singing is the 2nd Thursday this month, so if you were planning an extended 4th of July holiday you won't miss it.    The singing at Crossroad Baptist Church has been moved to 3rd Sunday, July 15 at Muscadine Methodist Church.

 </p><p>

Also note that singings from the Christian Harmony are 7-shape singings.  And “Note singings” are 7-shape gospel singings (see <a href= "notesing.html">our note singing page</a>) and more information can be provided by Joyce Hammock, jvhammock -at- yahoo -dot- com.
