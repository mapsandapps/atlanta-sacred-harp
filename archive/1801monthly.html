<h1>January 2018 Singings</h1>

<p align = "center">Updated January 12, 2018</p>
<p><font color = "red">Update:</font>We are baffled by change, and changed by baffles.  The basement space at St John's has been modified, and is no longer suitable for group singing.  We are incredibly grateful for their hospitality these last few years.
</p><p>
* The LAST "4th Wednesday Singing" will be held at Andy and David's house on 24-January at 7:00 PM
</p><p>
* The 2nd Wednesday singing is NO MORE.  By consensus, we have decided to sing on the 2nd TUESDAY of each month from now on, with no regular singing scheduled in the 4th week of the month.  Occasional special events or singing schools may be scheduled during the 4th week.
</p><p>
* Plan to sing at Andy and David's again on Tuesday 13-February, 7:00 PM; however,...
</p><p>
* We are actively seeking a NEW VENUE for our regular SECOND TUESDAY singing, beginning on 13-March.  There seems to be a lot of interest in finding an east side location, such as Decatur or Oakhurst.  Please speak up if you have ideas.</p>
<p>Warm yourself by making the air vibrate with the old sounds in the new year!  Note:  singing school on the 13th in Eatonton, new location for Auburn singing on the 20th.
