<h1>December 2019 Singings</h1>

<p align = "center">Updated December 6, 2019</p>

<p><font color = "red">Update:</font> The venue has changed for the December 7th Note Singing Banquet. See below. </p>

<p>

Sacred Harp Singings are free and open to the public. All are welcome (including children of all ages). The only requirement for singing Sacred Harp is the desire to sing Sacred Harp. This is a participatory style of singing, not a concert or performance, so you are always welcome (and encouraged!) to join in. An offering is usually taken to defray expenses. 


</p><p>

For “All-Day” singings:
</p><p>
There will be a Dinner on the Grounds around noon (potluck) unless otherwise noted. Please stay and eat even if you didn’t bring food. There is always enough to go around. 

</p><p>

Singing start times are noted, but end times vary depending on how many singers/leaders attend. You can usually expect “All-Day” singings to end between 2:00 and 3:00 pm.

</p><p>

All singings are from The Sacred Harp 1991 edition unless otherwise noted. For Google maps for all these singings, please see the links on the pages for <a href="annual.html">annual singings</a>, <a href="localgroups.html">local groups</a> or <a href="notesing.html">note singings</a>. For easier reading of the listings, driving directions for most singings have been moved to the bottom of this page.

</p><p>

NEW!!!! If you need a ride or would like to carpool, please email me, Lisa Bennett, at AtlantaSinging -at- gmail -dot- com or text me at 404-402-9562, and we will see if we can start matching up more singers to carpool to singings. In your message please say your name, which singing you want to go to, and where you live. Also, if you have access to MARTA, what station or bus lines you are near. THIS IS A TEST and I have no idea how it will work out, but let’s try to save some gas, help some car-less singers or people like me who hate to drive distances, and have some fun and fellowship while we’re at it. IF YOU HAVE ROOM in your car or van, and would like to offer a ride, let me know that, too!
