<h1>July 2022 Singings</h1>

<font color = "red">Update:</font> Sorry for the late notice here, but the 1st Thursday Singing at Emory Presbyterian is is canceled for July.  There is an uptick in COVID cases lately. We've been singing outdoors at Emory Pres, but the forecast is to be very hot over the next few days (evening temps in the 80's/90's and 'feels like' temps in the mid-90's to 100 range) has led to this decision. We'll hope to be back on schedule for 1st Thursday in August.
