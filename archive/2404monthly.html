Due to lack of use during the Covid years, there are repairs that need to be made to State Line Church in order to make it usable for an April singing in Alabama. We really appreciate the generosity of Judy Henry and her family for allowing us to use Holly Springs on such short notice. Please bring a covered dish for lunch.
