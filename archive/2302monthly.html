David has been the facilitator/convener of the 1st Thursday singing for several years (thank you David!!) and the February singing will be his last in that capacity. If you would be interested, willing, able to take on this role beginning in March please let me (or David) know.  It primarily involves having the key to open/close the fellowship hall at EP, keeping up with the Eclectic Harmony and Sacred Harp loaners, and being a point of contact with the EP church contact.

A note about this newsletter. I’m working towards limiting the singings listed to singings IN GEORGIA.  I will list out of state singings BY REQUEST of the organizer or a primary contact AND that are within a 2-3 hour drive from Atlanta (ie-not an overnight stay needed).
