<h1>January 2019 Singings</h1>

<p align = "center">Updated December 30, 2018</p>

<p>
I hope you have all had a wonderful holiday season so far. Happy New Year! If one of your New Year's Resolutions has been to sing more in 2019, you have a lot of opportunities in January to get a good start on this goal. I hope to sing with each and every one of you very soon. If you have questions about this reminder or have singings to post, please note the new email address for this purpose: 
AtlantaSinging@gmail.com. 
</p><p>
Please note that all these singings are also listed at atlantasacredharp.org , where you will also find a map with each singing marked, and GPS coordinates for each location.

Thanks, Laura Akerman, for keeping up with this list for years and years. I hope passing this responsibility on to me will give you a bit of breathing room in your over-full schedule.
</p><p>
Thanks, <br>Lisa
