          Sacred Harp Family - many of you will remember Bob Goodman, who was a
          very active singer until 2016 or so. His long-time companion, Janet
          Wuichet, called me today to pass along the sad news of Bob's death, on
          Sept 27, in California, where his children had moved him. She has
          asked if some singers could come to Bob's memorial potluck on the
          evening of Sunday, Oct 13, 6-10 pm, at the First Existentialist
          Church. There are more details in the email below. I spoke with one of
          the organizers, Stephanie Coffin, today and she asked if one of us
          could give a brief explanation of how shape note singing works, and
          for us to sing a few songs. There will be other singers there from
          various groups Bob belonged to, and many of them might wish to join
          in. I thought we could print up a small packet of songs to share. We
          do have a limited amount of time, so we have to make any explanation
          very brief, and we will only have time for about 4 songs, at a guess.
          (Another group will be leading the attendees in Amazing Grace.)

          I'll serve as point person on this for a rough head count.<br />Please
          let me know if you plan to attend.

        <p>BOB GOODMAN MEMORIAL POTLUCK</p>
        <p>Friends—</p>
        <p>
          Longtime activist Bob Goodman died on September 27 in California, far
          from his Atlanta home. Knowing that Bob no longer has family here, a
          group of old friends decided that a potluck get together in his honor
          and memory might be appropriate. We have reserved space on

          Sunday, October 13, 2024<br />
          6 — 10 pm<br />
          First Existentialist Church<br />
          470 Candler Park Dr<br />
          Atlanta, GA
        </p>
        <p>
          We are trying to contact as many people as possible who knew Bob. We
          are contacting Great Speckled Bird folk, October League cadre, Georgia
          Peace and Justice Coalition activists, Atlanta Grandmothers for Peace,
          the First Existentialist Church congregation, Shape Note and other
          singing groups, and various individuals. If you know of people or
          organizations that knew and worked with Bob, please help out by
          contacting them. Don't worry about duplication.
        </p>
        <p>
          A program has not yet been worked out beyond an opening potluck
          dinner. Please keep dishes on the simpler side (as in “finger food”)
          to ease clean-up.
        </p>
        <p>
          After dinner we anticipate some group singing and sing-along, followed
          by personal reflections on and/or stories about Bob. That should top
          off the evening, we think.
        </p>
        <p>
          An advance head count might be useful. If you anticipate attending,
          please drop a text to (404) 947-5366 or an email to tomcoffin@mac.com.
        </p>
        <p>Please mark the date and plan to come!!</p>
