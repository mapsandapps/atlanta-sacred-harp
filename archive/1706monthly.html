We'll have just the briefest of introductions and then take turns leading songs from a packet of selections from the 1991 Edition, hopefully with a few conference attendees joining each of us in the hollow square. After the singing, Sacred Harp singers are invited to join the librarians for supper, catered by Bell Street Burritos, at the Pitts Theology Library. Please arrive by 5:00 pm.
