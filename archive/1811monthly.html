<h1>November 2018 Singings</h1>

<p align = "center">Updated November 11, 2018</p>

<p>
The trees have decided it is autumn, and are showing splendid colors on schedule this year in our area.  Great time for a trip to a singing, whether near or far.
</p><p>
Lots of notes:  
</p><p>
Judy Mincey wrote:  "It is with great sorrow I must announce the cancellation of the Elder and Mrs. Jason Davis Memorial Singing. This is scheduled for the third Sunday in November, the 18th, at the Historic Sugar Valley Baptist Church, Sugar Valley, GA. Hopefully it will just be for this year."
</p><p>
Oscar McGuire wants everyone to know that the location for the Georgian Harmony singing was listed wrong in the Minute Book.  It will be at the Hollingsworth's in Ila Ga., not in Roberta.  See entry at Nov. 17.
</p><p>
There will be no First Thursday singing at Emory Presbyterian in December.  The annual Christmas singing will be at Church of our Saviour again this year, on December 16, starting at 3 p.m., singing from the Sacred Harp, Eclectic Harmony, American Christmas Harp, or whatever songs you bring copies of, we will have "supper on the grounds" at 5 p.m. and then sing some more.  Mark your calendars.
</p><p>
John Plunkett is looking for singers who can sing for the "Candlelight Nights" event at Atlanta History Center on December 14th and 21st, at 7 and 8 p.m.  Contact him, bildad12- at- hotmail -dot- com, 470-230-5757, if you can help with this - it should be a merry time outdoors and with cider to warm you. 
</p><p>
John has another notice:  "Jan. 12, Sat., Singing school/All day singing  Please come help with a singing school/singing at Lake Oconee Lutheran Church, 1089 Lake Oconee Parkway, Eatonton, Ga. 31024.  We'll start at 10am with a singing school/extended introductory lesson and progress into a regular singing as the day goes on.  Covered dish lunch at noon; the church will provide meats (ham and/or chicken and I think drinks), so bring side dishes, desserts or other meats/protein for the covered dish lunch at noon.  Would be great to have some experienced singers help boost the class."   
</p><p>
 
At the Seed and Feed singing, it was announced that next year's Seed and Feed will be held at a new location:  Northlake Church of Christ, Jim Neal's church.  We will provide more information and directions next year.
