<h1>March 2020 Singings</h1>

<p align = "center">Updated March 21, 2020</p>

<p>We update this page when we get word that a singing has been cancelled.  Really you should just assume they're all cancelled.
Stay safe, keep your distance, and eat takeout from <a href="https://www.bellstreetburritos.com/">Bell Street Burritos</a>,
the only restaurant decorated with Sacred Harp Rudiments.</p>
<p><font color = "red">Update: </font>The Middle Georgia Sacred Harp singing at Union PBC in 
Goggans, GA is cancelled. Normally held the Saturday before the 3rd Sunday of April.</p>

<p><font color = "red">Update: </font>The Georgian Harmony singing scheduled for Saturday, March 28th in Roberta, GA, is cancelled.</p>

<p><font color = "red">Update: </font>The Georgia State Sacred Harp convention is cancelled.  
"Officers for the 2020 Georgia State Sacred Harp Convention are in agreement that the Convention
should be canceled this year. It was not a decision we take lightly, but prudent given the
available information regarding the virus that causes Covid-19. This decision fits
recommendations regarding slowing the spread of the virus over the coming weeks, and
with a desire to keep our singing community, friends, and family safe. We hope all of
you will join us next year on the fourth Sunday in March and the Saturday before.<br>
Mike Spencer, Chair; Kathy Williams, Vice Chair; Lela Crowder, Secretary."<br>
Also David Ivey shares that the Friday night singing (March 20) of submitted songs is cancelled.
</p>

<p><font color = "red">Update: </font>This month's Third Sunday singing is cancelled. Be safe, everyone!.</p>

<p><font color = "red">Update: </font>The 2nd Tuesday singing at Holy Trinity is cancelled.  Several of the regulars
are sick (the usual colds etc., not COVID-19) and we thought it best to cancel rather than expose
our fellow singers.</p>

<p>

Sacred Harp Singings are free and open to the public. All are welcome (including children of all ages). The only requirement for singing Sacred Harp is the desire to sing Sacred Harp. This is a participatory style of singing, not a concert or performance, so you are always welcome (and encouraged!) to join in. An offering is usually taken to defray expenses. 


</p><p>

For “All-Day” singings:
</p><p>
There will be a Dinner on the Grounds around noon (potluck) unless otherwise noted. Please stay and eat even if you didn’t bring food. There is always enough to go around. 

</p><p>

Singing start times are noted, but end times vary depending on how many singers/leaders attend. You can usually expect “All-Day” singings to end between 2:00 and 3:00 pm.

</p><p>

All singings are from The Sacred Harp 1991 edition unless otherwise noted. For Google maps for all these singings, please see the links on the pages for <a href="annual.html">annual singings</a>, <a href="localgroups.html">local groups</a> or <a href="notesing.html">note singings</a>. For easier reading of the listings, driving directions for most singings have been moved to the bottom of this page.

</p><p>

If you need a ride or would like to carpool, please email me, Lisa Bennett, at 
AtlantaSinging -at- gmail -dot- com or text me at 404-402-9562, and we will see if we can 
start matching up more singers to carpool to singings. In your message please say your name, 
which singing you want to go to, and where you live. Also, if you have access to MARTA, 
what station or bus lines you are near. Let’s try to save some gas, help some car-less singers 
or people like me who hate to drive distances, and have some fun and fellowship while we’re at it. 
IF YOU HAVE ROOM in your car or van, and would like to offer a ride, let me know that, too! 

</p><p>
This Month: Please note that the Atlanta 3rd Sunday Singing will be meeting in a new location this month. Thanks to Bill DuPre, we will be singing at Haygood Memorial United Methodist Church. See details in the listing below.

</p><p>

Don’t forget the Georgia State Convention is March 21-22 at Emmaus in Carrolton. Come, bring friends, and bring food. We might also have singers looking for housing in/near Atlanta, rides to/from airport, etc. 

</p><p>

The New Echota Lantern Tour Singing will not conflict with the Georgia State Convention this year! Consider making the lovely drive up to sing in the reconstructed wooden courthouse building at this historic site, the former capital of the Cherokee Nation. Judy Mincey encourages singers to bring a lantern if you like, and arrive by 6:30 pm to get settled in for the singing that starts at 7:00 pm. Your Sacred Harp book will be your ticket into the event. Let Judy know if you are planning to come. See contact info below.

</p><p>

Looking ahead:
</p><p>
Save the date for the Atlanta All-Day at Holy Trinity Episcopal Parish in Decatur on Saturday, Apr. 25, and a public singing school on Thursday evening April 23.  More details in next month’s email.

</p><p>

It’s time to register for Camp! - Info at the end of this email.

</p><p>

Note that the Spivey Hall Singing in July has been cancelled.
</p><p>
Sing On! Lisa
