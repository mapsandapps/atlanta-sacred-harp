Thanks to generous support from Georgia Humanities, the exhibition will open at the Center for the Arts on Friday evening before moving to the Sacred Harp Museum. We're hoping to build awareness for singing in West Georgia by reaching out to the community in downtown Carrollton. We'd be especially grateful for any singers who could come on Friday at around 5:30 so we can sing a few songs. The Carrollton Center for the Arts is located just off the square at 251 Alabama Street, near a range of excellent dining options, with plenty of free parking.
