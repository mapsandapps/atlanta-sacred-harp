<h1>April 2017 Singings</h1>

<p align = "center">Updated April 2, 2017</p>

<p>Plenty of good singing opportunities - near and far.  Come sing with us!!

</p><p>

Friday, Jun 16th - Several of you were able to help with a program last October in conjunction with the Historic Rural Churches of Georgia project.  Another, similar opportunity is coming up in June, though this is being coordinated through the Georgia Department of Tourism.   Unfortunately, Friday, June 16th is during the National Convention in Birmingham - so I'm asking early if you could let me know your interest/availability/willingness to be a part of this.  If you can let me know/commit by the 1st of May, I would greatly appreciate it.   The program would be ~30 minutes long (and I think they will have box lunches for us!).   The location is Wrightsboro Methodist Church, in McDuffie County (near Augusta) - so about 2 hours east of Atlanta. Here are some pictures of the church:  <a href="http://hrcga.org/wrightsboro-methodist-mcduffie-3/">http://hrcga.org/wrightsboro-methodist-mcduffie-3/</a>
