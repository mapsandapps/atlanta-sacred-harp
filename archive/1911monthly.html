<h1>November 2019 Singings</h1>

<p align = "center">Updated October 31, 2019</p>

<p>

Sacred Harp Singings are free and open to the public. All are welcome (including children of all ages). The only requirement for singing Sacred Harp is the desire to sing Sacred Harp. This is a participatory style of singing, not a concert or performance, so you are always welcome (and encouraged!) to join in. An offering is usually taken to defray expenses. 


</p><p>

For “All-Day” singings:
</p><p>
There will be a Dinner on the Grounds around noon (potluck) unless otherwise noted. Please stay and eat even if you didn’t bring food. There is always enough to go around. 

</p><p>

Singing start times are noted, but end times vary depending on how many singers/leaders attend. You can usually expect “All-Day” singings to end between 2:00 and 3:00 pm.

</p><p>

All singings are from The Sacred Harp 1991 edition unless otherwise noted. For Google maps for all these singings, please see the links on the pages for <a href="annual.html">annual singings</a>, <a href="localgroups.html">local groups</a> or <a href="notesing.html">note singings</a>. For easier reading of the listings, driving directions for most singings have been moved to the bottom of this page.

</p><p>

NEW!!!! If you need a ride or would like to carpool, please email me, Lisa Bennett, at AtlantaSinging -at- gmail -dot- com or text me at 404-402-9562, and we will see if we can start matching up more singers to carpool to singings. In your message please say your name, which singing you want to go to, and where you live. Also, if you have access to MARTA, what station or bus lines you are near. THIS IS A TEST and I have no idea how it will work out, but let’s try to save some gas, help some car-less singers or people like me who hate to drive distances, and have some fun and fellowship while we’re at it. IF YOU HAVE ROOM in your car or van, and would like to offer a ride, let me know that, too!

Singings List

</h2>

<p>As the days shorten, the singing year is winding down. There are still plenty of good singings this month, though. Pay particular attention to the Denney Memorial and Holly Springs singings this coming weekend, the Georgian Harmony Singing on Nov. 16, and the Alabama State Sacred Harp Convention in Birmingham on Nov. 23-24 (*not* Thanksgiving weekend this year).Please note that the Georgia Christian Harmony Convention in Athens starts Nov. 30, as the first Sunday of December is the 1st. It was a great singing last year - both a strong class and a resonant venue.

</p><p>

Also, per Judy Mincey, the Davis Memorial at Sugar Valley will be cancelled this year.  

</p><p>

The Christian Harmony singing in Athens will also be cancelled this month.

</p><p>

For December, save the date for our joint Atlanta Christmas Singing, Sunday, Dec. 15, 3:00 pm. 

</p><p>
Sing On! Lisa
