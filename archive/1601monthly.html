<H1 align = "center">January 2016 Singings</H1>	   

<p align = "center">Updated January 26, 2016</p>

<br>
<p><font color = "red">Update:</font> We now have the location for the Biweekly singing on January 27. This will be the regular location from now on. Check it out if you haven't already!</p>
<p>January has some interesting opportunities for singing if the weather permits you to travel a bit (or, just stay home and catch up with friends at our local regular evening singings).  I included the Faircloth Memorial Cooper Book singing in Bonifay, FL on the 17th - a bit far, but it's on the panhandle and might be a nice time to go down there.  Note the Camp Fasola dates at the end - it won't be too early to sign up.
