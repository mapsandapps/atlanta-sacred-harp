<h1>February 2020 Singings</h1>

<p align = "center">Updated Feburary 19, 2020</p>

<p>

Sacred Harp Singings are free and open to the public. All are welcome (including children of all ages). The only requirement for singing Sacred Harp is the desire to sing Sacred Harp. This is a participatory style of singing, not a concert or performance, so you are always welcome (and encouraged!) to join in. An offering is usually taken to defray expenses. 


</p><p>

For “All-Day” singings:
</p><p>
There will be a Dinner on the Grounds around noon (potluck) unless otherwise noted. Please stay and eat even if you didn’t bring food. There is always enough to go around. 

</p><p>

Singing start times are noted, but end times vary depending on how many singers/leaders attend. You can usually expect “All-Day” singings to end between 2:00 and 3:00 pm.

</p><p>

All singings are from The Sacred Harp 1991 edition unless otherwise noted. For Google maps for all these singings, please see the links on the pages for <a href="annual.html">annual singings</a>, <a href="localgroups.html">local groups</a> or <a href="notesing.html">note singings</a>. For easier reading of the listings, driving directions for most singings have been moved to the bottom of this page.

</p><p>

If you need a ride or would like to carpool, please email me, Lisa Bennett, at 
AtlantaSinging -at- gmail -dot- com or text me at 404-402-9562, and we will see if we can 
start matching up more singers to carpool to singings. In your message please say your name, 
which singing you want to go to, and where you live. Also, if you have access to MARTA, 
what station or bus lines you are near. Let’s try to save some gas, help some car-less singers 
or people like me who hate to drive distances, and have some fun and fellowship while we’re at it. 
IF YOU HAVE ROOM in your car or van, and would like to offer a ride, let me know that, too! 

</p><p>

Remember that we have several college-based singings in February, but most notably the Emory Singing at Cannon Chapel, Feb 8, starting at 10:00 am, and the University of Georgia Social Harp/Sacred Harp singing at the State Botanical Garden in Athens on Feb. 23. It’s the only annual singing from the Social Harp, which was published in Georgia in 1855.  Please join us!

</p><p>
Looking ahead: The Georgia State Sacred Harp Convention will be March 21-22 this year.

</p><p>

Also, from Judy Mincey -"We are invited to sing Saturday evening, March 28 from 7PM to 9PM 
in the reconstructed Supreme Court House at The New Echota Historic Site near Calhoun. 
This will be a guided lantern light tour event. The room is fantastic, a tiny wooden box. 
We could make a plan to meet somewhere for dinner beforehand if folks are interested. 
Please let me know if you are interested. 779-773-0818 or Mincey.judy-at-yahoo.com ."

This singing often falls during the Georgia State weekend, but we will not have that 
conflict this year. It’s a good drive from Atlanta, but the room is terrific and the drive should be lovely in late March.

</p><p>
Sing On! Lisa
