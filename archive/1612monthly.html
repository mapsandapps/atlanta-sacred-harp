Jan. 7, 2017 - John Plunkett writes:  Please come help with a singing school/singing near Greensboro, GA.   First United Methodist Church, South Campus at Lake Oconee.  4741 Carey Station Road, just off hwy 44 south of Greensboro.   We'll start at 10am with a singing school/extended introductory lesson and progress into a regular singing as the day goes on.  They are expecting  40-50 people to attend.   Would be great to have some experienced singers help boost the class.
