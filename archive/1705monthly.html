May we sing?  We may!  And can, and will!
</p><p>
Note the pair of singing schools in Rutherfordton N.C. over Memorial Day weekend, and mark calendars for the June singing school week at Flat Shoals Primitive Baptist Church, and the historic church demonstration singing on June 16, and come if you can!  I added a couple of "far-ish" singings in case you want to get away - the Memphis singing  May 13, and the Big Singing in Benton, Kentucky on the 28th.  There's supposed to be a Sacred Harp singing in Benton on the 27th but I don't have details as of now.  Also note, Savannah singing is now at the Skidway Island United Methodist church, and the Piccolo Spoleto Charleston singing is in a new location also.

Friday, Jun 16th - Several of you were able to help with a program last October in conjunction with the Historic Rural Churches of Georgia project.  
Another, similar opportunity is coming up in June, though this is being coordinated through the Georgia Department of Tourism.   
Unfortunately, Friday, June 16th is during the National Convention in Birmingham - so I'm asking early if you could let me know your interest/availability/willingness 
to be a part of this.  If you can let me know/commit by the 1st of May, I would greatly appreciate it.   The program would be ~30 minutes long 
(and I think they will have box lunches for us!).   The location is Wrightsboro Methodist Church, in McDuffie County (near Augusta) - so about 2 hours east of Atlanta.   
Here are some pictures of the church:  <a href="http://hrcga.org/wrightsboro-methodist-mcduffie-3/">http://hrcga.org/wrightsboro-methodist-mcduffie-3/</a>  Info:  John Plunkett, 470-230-5757, bildad12 -at- hotmail –dot- com</p>
