      <p>
        There are several local shape-note singing groups in Georgia that meet four or more times a year for about 2 hours at a time. These singings are less
        formal than all-day singings. Since they meet frequently and tend to attract the same group of people each time, they offer an especially comfortable
        environment for practicing singing and leading skills. Newcomers are always welcome.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be aware that locations can change and singings can be rescheduled or cancelled. Check our <a href="monthly.html">upcoming singings page</a> for the
        latest information.

      <h2 align="left">Atlanta First Thursday Singing</h2>
      <!-- worded like this to match the newspaper announcments -->
      <p>
        Our informal First Thursday singing is a good place for beginners in the Atlanta area to learn this style of music. We begin at 7:30 pm. Participants
        take turns choosing songs from the <i>Sacred Harp</i> (1991 ed.) until 8:30. During a short break for refreshments, we pass out copies of
        <i>An Eclectic Harmony</i>, a shape note sampler book that includes several beloved late 19th century hymns. Singing continues from both books until
        9:30. Songbooks are available to borrow, buy, or share.
