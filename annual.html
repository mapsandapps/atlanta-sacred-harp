        Annual singings are the best place to experience Sacred Harp. They might be big or small, old (over 150 years) or new. Most annual singings are all-day
        singings with dinner at noon. They usually start at 10:00 Eastern (9:30 for big singings) in Georgia or 9:00 Central in Alabama. They end around 2:30 or
        3:00, after everyone who wants to lead a song has had a turn. Newcomers are always welcome.
      </p>
      <p>
        The list of Georgia and eastern Alabama singings below is generated from Warren Steel's
        <a href="http://www.mcsr.olemiss.edu/~mudws/annual.html">annual Sacred Harp directory</a> and
        <a href="http://home.olemiss.edu/~mudws/charmony.html">annual Christian Harmony directory</a>. Sometimes singings change or are cancelled at the last
        minute. Detailed up-to-date confirmed information is given each month on our <a href="monthly.html">upcoming singings page</a>.

        <!-- For the dates of Sundays this year, refer to our <a href="calendar.html">calendar page</a>.-->
